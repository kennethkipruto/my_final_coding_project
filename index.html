          <p>Just how easy is it to get a place to pee in Berkeley? The simple answer: Not easy. There is a restroom problem in Berkeley, and the authorities know about it.</p>

          <p>While the city has in recent years embarked on a mission to increase access to public sanitation facilities by providing portable toilets in areas where there was a shortage, the pandemic has rendered most restrooms inaccessible, making Berkeley rather bladder-unfriendly.</p>
         
          <p>With most businesses and activities closed, and most buildings at the University of California campus closed as learning went remote, finding a place to answer a call of nature has become a desperate search.</p>
          
          <p>“I did not know there was a restroom problem in Berkeley until I went to campus and had to pee desperately but ended up going on a wild goose chase around the university and into Downtown Berkeley,” says Elena Neale, a graduate student at UC Berkeley. “We walked into stores and cafes that did not have bathrooms or wouldn’t let us use them because of COVID-19”.</p>
          
          <p>Elena and her classmate Zachary Fletcher had gone to the campus one Sunday afternoon in March to meet a friend. They both live off campus. When the call of nature came, they had to go on some sort of a treasure hunt to answer it. </p>
          
          <p>“It took us 30 minutes of badly needing to use a restroom to get one. We kept going into stores and restaurants asking to be allowed to use a bathroom and being confronted with no access signs or being turned away,” Fletcher says.</p>

          <p>In 2017, the City of Berkeley hired a consultant to look into existing restroom infrastructure and recommend solutions to a growing accessibility problem, reveals Berkeley’s 2020 Citywide Restroom Study. </p>
          
          <p>The study identified the sidewalks at Downtown and Ashby bart stations, the Telegraph-Channing garage sidewalks as well as the intersection of San Pablo and College avenues as the places with the most urgent need of restroom facilities.</p>

          <p>But it also highlighted that even pre-pandemic times, residents had complained about most public sanitation facilities not being well cleaned and maintained and had no soap. Others said they did not feel safe using some restrooms.</p>

          <p>At the onset of the pandemic last year, the City says it deployed an additional 14 portable toilets and 22 handwashing stations to meet the shortage created by the closures of public restrooms. </p>

          <p>Since 2016, Berkeley has directed $100 million to improve city buildings and infrastructure, including restrooms. In 2017, restroom studies and improvements were given $120,000, as the city worked alongside community groups for the unhoused to determine where most unhoused communities are congregated and in need of facilities, where to place restrooms and how to monitor them.</p>
          
          <p> Still, getting access to a restroom is not easy, especially for the unhoused community.</p>

          <p class="fs-2 fw-bold text-left">Necessity, Not Convenience</p>
          
          
          <p>“For the unhoused person, a bathroom is a necessity, not a convenience,” says Fletcher, who after his desperate search for a restroom could only empathise with those who go through it every day. </p>

          <p>Lisa Teague, a member of the People’s Park Committee -- a body of community members and activists charged with maintaining the space since its inception in 1969 -- has taken on the task of restroom upkeep amidst a dearth of services provided by UC Berkeley to assist unhoused residents who have tented there since 2018.</p>
          
          <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the park has become an increasingly more vital refuge for the unhoused. Teague says it’s been years since UC Berkeley properly cleaned the restrooms activists built in 2017.</p>
          
          <p>“In 2018, they suddenly stopped cleaning them. We were never told why. They stopped bringing in soap and toilet paper, so that I and others then had to purchase them and clean the bathrooms,” she says.</p>
          
          <p>So bad was the situation that Teague wrote an op-ed for the Daily Cal in 2018, decrying the state in which UC has left these basic necessities. Now, Teague says UC Berkeley provids workers to wash the restroom once or twice a week.</p>

          <p>No stalls exist inside the current public restroom, bar porter-potties provided outside the building - but also not cleaned regularly. Lisa must still come in with a mop and soap to scrub, and sometimes remove clothing items, feces and urine from walls and floors. </p>
          
          <p>“The sinks have never been proper sinks, so the faucet is short and small, the water comes back against the wall and you have to press the button to make it work. Barely any water comes out. It’s a jailhouse kind of arrangement,” Teague says of the ability to wash hands or even shower with the single sink.</p>
          
          <p>In spite of the lack of sanitary restrooms, residents in People’s Park attempt to maintain their dignity when going. Bushes and trees in the upper right corner of the park provide places for women to clean themselves in private. </p>

          <p> In an incident Teague remembers well, an unhoused woman named Sunshine “dropped her pants” and urinated in front of three police officers who were harassing a male unhoused park resident for alleged public urination. </p>
          
          <p>Arrests for urinating or defecating in public are uncommon but do happen, and when they do, they rob a person of their dignity, says Danie Homer, the managing attorney of the Homeless Action Center in West Oakland.</p>

          <p>“Access to a bathroom is a basic human right,” he says. “Lack of access to a bathroom is a pressure point”.</p>
          
          <p>In Alameda County, there's no specific law against urinating in public. Offenders can be charged with public nuisance, disorderly conduct, or the more grievous charge of indecent exposure which “requires specific intent beyond just the need to use the bathroom”, according to Homer.</p>

          
          <p>Indecent exposure becomes complicated as suspects are put on sex offender charges, he says.</p>
          
          <p>In 2019, the UC Berkeley Police Department received one report of someone urinating in public, and three reports of defecation on the ground at buildings on or near campus. In these cases, a citation PC 314 was issued, which, according to California law, entails warnings and fines for “lewd or obscene conduct and indecent exposure”. The most serious punishments can be jail time of up to a year for a misdemeanor charge, or even charges for felony exposure, depending on the motivation and location of the crime. </p>

          <p>When Ari Neulight began working for People’s Park, the first pressing issue he was confronted with -  both by local businesses and the unhoused communities in People’s Park -  was the lack of housing and restroom availability in Berkeley. City parks and public restrooms had limited hours - none were available around the clock, and there weren’t enough clean, usable facilities.</p>
          
          <iframe width="360" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl-raYt3nPg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          
          
          <p>Neulight’s solution was to regularly get together with nonprofit student groups like the Suitcase Clinic, as well as other city groups for the unhoused, to come up with a plan. The Suitcase Clinic had produced a map outlining restroom needs in the city, but had no channels of communication with the city.</p>
          
          <p>“How are there ways for us to work together across the leadership?” he pondered.</p>
          
          <p>He’s seen this cooperation blossom during the pandemic, especially in a more community-oriented model of addressing homelessness. Neulight meets weekly with Telegraph Business Improvement District ambassadors, and with unhoused leadership once or twice a month.</p>
